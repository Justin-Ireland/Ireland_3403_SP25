# region imports
#This way of importing is saying from (the module) random, import (the function) random
#Other ways of importing might be:  import random
#             In the above case, we access the function random as random.random()
#Another way to import might be:  from random import random as rnd
#             In the above case, we use rnd() to produce a random number
